# Smart-Recipe-Generator
This project is a Smart Recipe Recommender, a responsive web application that helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand and their dietary preferences. Built entirely on the client side using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is a self-contained, no-backend solution.
