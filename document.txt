ðŸ“„ Project Approach â€“ Smart Recipe Recommender
1. Problem Statement

Many people struggle to decide what to cook with the ingredients they already have at home. Additionally, dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.) make it harder to quickly find suitable recipes. Existing solutions are either too complex or do not provide personalized suggestions.

2. Objectives

Develop a simple web-based application that suggests recipes based on available ingredients.

Allow users to apply dietary filters such as vegetarian or gluten-free.

Provide detailed instructions and nutritional information for each recipe.

Enable users to save and rate recipes for future personalized recommendations.

3. Methodology

-->  Frontend Development

Build the interface using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

Create input fields for ingredients and dietary preferences.

Display suggested recipes dynamically.

-->  Recipe Generation Logic

Store a predefined recipe database with ingredients, steps, and nutrition info.

Match user-provided ingredients with available recipes.

Apply filters (dietary restrictions, cooking time, difficulty).

-->  User Feedback System

Allow users to rate recipes and mark favorites.

Store preferences locally to generate better future suggestions.

-->  Nutritional Information

Include calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates for each recipe.

Provide users with an overview of the health value of recipes.

4. Expected Outcome

A user-friendly web application where users can input ingredients and get instant recipe suggestions.

Ability to filter recipes by preferences and cooking time.

Recipes displayed with instructions and nutritional values.

Future scalability to integrate with APIs or AI for smarter recipe recommendations.

5. Future Scope

Integration with real-time recipe APIs for a larger recipe database.

AI-based personalization for smarter recipe recommendations.

Mobile app version for iOS and Android.

Shopping list generator based on selected recipes.
